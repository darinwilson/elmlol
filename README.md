# ElmLol

Do something, anything in Elm.

## Setup

  * [install Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/get_started.html) (if you haven't already)
  * clone this repo
  * `cd elmlol`
  * `elm-reactor`
  * point your browser to http://localhost:8000/elmlol.html

## So what is this exactly?

A playground for experimenting and sharing with Elm. No idea is to small or too silly. Just add a new subdirectory and start coding.

Once you've made something, submit a PR so we can all see it. And tell us what you learned!
